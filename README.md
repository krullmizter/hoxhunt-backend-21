A solution to the Hoxhunt 2021 Backend/Frontend summer intern [task](https://hunters.hoxhunt.com/#/challenge), made by: Samuel Granvik üëã

I built the solution with JavaScript, and used Node.js to test out the code. `node algorithm.js`
------------
#### Execution

My solution uses separate arrays that get their data *pushed* to them from the initial `emails` array. I then loop through the `emails` array to handle the logic with an `if-statement`.

The `includes();` method gets used in the `if-statement` logic to handle what email *rule* to follow , and then add it to the final `villainArr`.

##### The logic of the rules

If the first first rule of the `if-statement` logic is true (i.e. If the last name **does**  containt a letter: **r**), then I break the `for-loop` with a `continue;` and move on to the next loop iteration.

The next `if-else` statements takes care of the lesser rules, and adds the corresponding emails to the `villainArr` if they are true.

The last rule takes advantage of a Reg-ex to check whether the current itterations email address's last name contains two or more **"t"**s. 

------------
#### Conclusion

One can of course improve the solution to maybe use more regular expressions, or to use a less resource tense `if-statement` logic, and add some unit tests. 
One could also create another function or method to check if the number of the algorithm is actually a prime number. 

But all in the solution works and I'm okay with the current code. 
Thanks for checking it out! üôè
